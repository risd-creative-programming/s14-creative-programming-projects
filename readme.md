##Overview

This course is a graduate-level hands-on creative-programming studio, supporting conceptual and technical research and development as students build ambitious projects of their own design. This course is ideal for students working on projects with elements involving code and needing a shared research dialogue and space within which to work, ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas. The course will consist of a combination of individual meetings, group critiques, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops. Access to a full array of languages will be supported. Workshops will focus on more refined technical strategies regarding organizing, sharing and working with large quantities of code, as well as additional topics specific to students' needs. The course will also encourage students to articulate the conceptual and material contexts of their work and to address the considerations of launching projects in social, online, hybrid and physical spaces of engagement.

        * 1. List out the technical tasks / todos you need to accomplish this week.
        * 2. Break into subtasks and estimate time for each.  How long do you think each subtask will take you?  Be as honest as you can.
        * 3. Time the subtasks as you complete them throughout the week.
        * 4. Bring notes on your estimated and actual times to class on Monday.
    * **Readings:**

    * **Project blog post**

####Week 5 - Mar 17: [Workshop 2 (Creative Coding Best Practices)](https://github.com/risd-creative-programming/s14-creative-programming-projects/blob/master/coding-best-practices-workshop.md)
* [Creative Coding Best Practices](https://github.com/risd-creative-programming/s14-creative-programming-projects/blob/master/coding-best-practices-workshop.md)

    * Debugging Strategies
    * __Homework (DUE March 17):__
        * **Prepare for the midterm on March 31.** You will have 15 minutes for presentation and feedback. You decide the format for your review and lead us through it. Think about what you hope to get out of the review and how you will elicit this feedback. Have in mind a few questions that you hope to find answers to. Give us a sense of what you've done so far, and where you're hoping to get to by the end of the semester. **Give us something to react to.** Make sure you have explicitly decided on the format before class, don't just wing it! After the reviews we will have a meta-discussion about the different types of crits we tried, how they worked, which feedback was helpful, next steps, etc.

##Course Expectations
This course is mostly self-directed.  As such, it will not contain many direct assignments.  When there are expected assignments to be completed, they will be assigned and clearly designated at least 1 week before they are due.  Evaluation will primarily come from your ability to:
- organize and schedule your project
- identify obstacles and articulate them to the class
- pursue critical research in your problem space
- provide critical feedback to your peers' projects

**In Person Meetings**  
On **March 3** and **April 14** you will have an in-person meeting with either Evelyn or Lauren to discuss your progress and technical hurdles.

**Check-ins**  
On check-in weeks, you will be expected to either sign up for a remote check-in via Skype/GoogleHangout, chat or to send an email with your progress and any questions.

**Mandatory Blog**  
Every student will be required to maintain an online log, blog or website detailing their progress on their project, with **weekly** detailed updates.  This will be required to receive a final grade in the class.

##Check-ins
There will be remote check-in weeks on weeks there is no in-person class meeting. You can sign up for an individual Skype/GoogleHangout check-in with either Evelyn or Lauren, you do not need sign up with your main advisor. There will be various time slots during the check-in weeks, sign-up for half hour sessions using the links below:
* [Lauren check-ins](https://doodle.com/lmccart)
* [Evelyn check-ins](https://doodle.com/evhan55)

Students need to document their work online somewhere, on a site of their choice (blog, [tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [wordpress](http//wordpress.org), wiki, github, etc). A weekly update should be posted by the start of class time each week (regardless of whether there’s an in person meeting or not), including:

* Updates, milestones achieved
* Open questions, roadblocks
* Goals for next week
